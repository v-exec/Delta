# Delta

_Delta_ is a collection of customizable webcam / kinect-cam filters originally made using Processing, and then recreated as shaders in Unity.

### To Run The Unity Filters (overall better than Processing)

Simply download the build from [v-os](https://v-os.ca/media/downloads/delta/Delta_windows.zip) and run it. Only works on Windows.

### To Run The Processing Filters

The collection requires [Processing 3.0+](https://processing.org/).

Kinect filters require the [KinectPV2](https://github.com/ThomasLengeling/KinectPV2) library for Windows. This library works best with Processing 3.0, nothing higher, nothing lower.
